# Raspberry Pi Pico Extender V1

This is a custom extender board for the Raspberry Pi Pico (https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).

It allows full use of the breadboard when prototyping and the pins labels on top for easier reference. The board also contains a USB-C connection for aux power (3V3 and 5V) if needed for high power components.

The board is designed with the same dimensions as a Pi Hat for easy mounting.
